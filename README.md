# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is created to explore and document the process of requirement analysis in software development. 

Requirement analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), where stakeholders' needs are gathered, analyzed, and clearly defined. The purpose of this repository is to provide examples, documentation, and case studies that illustrate effective requirement analysis techniques, tools, and best practices.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It ensures that the software to be developed aligns with the business goals, user needs, and technical feasibility.

During this phase, developers, business analysts, and stakeholders collaborate to create a clear and detailed understanding of the system requirements. These requirements serve as the foundation for system design, development, and testing.

### Importance in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
1. **Clarity of Objectives**: It helps all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the system should achieve.
2. **Prevents Costly Errors**: Identifying requirements early reduces the risk of rework, budget overruns, and delays.
3. **Improves Communication**: Serves as a bridge between business stakeholders and technical teams.
4. **Guides Design and Development**: Provides a roadmap for system architecture, coding, and testing.
5. **Ensures Quality and Satisfaction**: Well-defined requirements increase the chances of delivering software that meets user expectations.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in the success of any software project. Without proper analysis, projects often face challenges like missed deadlines, cost overruns, and unsatisfied users. Below are the key reasons why it is important:

1. **Minimizes Project Risks**  
   By clearly defining requirements at the start, the risk of scope creep, misunderstandings, and project failure is significantly reduced.

2. **Saves Time and Costs**  
   Properly analyzed requirements prevent unnecessary rework, shorten development cycles, and help optimize resource allocation, ultimately lowering project costs.

3. **Ensures User Satisfaction**  
   Gathering and validating requirements with stakeholders ensures that the final product meets the actual needs of users, increasing acceptance and satisfaction.

4. **Provides a Solid Foundation for Design and Testing**  
   Requirement analysis produces documentation that guides developers during design and provides benchmarks for testing teams to validate the system.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities that ensure the project starts on the right track. The five key activities are:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting raw requirements from stakeholders, users, documents, and existing systems. The goal is to understand the problem domain.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Actively engaging with stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, and brainstorming sessions to uncover both stated and hidden needs.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Organizing and recording the gathered requirements in clear, structured formats such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), use cases, or user stories.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Analyzing requirements for clarity, completeness, and feasibility. Creating models like data flow diagrams, UML diagrams, or prototypes to visualize the system.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Reviewing requirements with stakeholders and project teams to ensure accuracy, completeness, and alignment with business objectives before moving to design.

## Types of Requirements
In software development, requirements are broadly categorized into **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**. Below is a distinction using a **Booking Management Project** as a case study.

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements describe **what the system should do**. They define specific behaviors, tasks, or functions of the system.  

**Examples for the Booking Management Project:**
- The system shall allow users to create a new booking for hotels, flights, or rental services.  
- The system shall provide users with the ability to view, update, or cancel an existing booking.  
- The system shall send email or SMS confirmations after a booking is successfully completed.  
- The system shall allow administrators to generate booking reports.  
- The system shall integrate with a payment gateway to process online payments.  

---

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements describe **how the system should perform**. They define quality attributes, constraints, and overall characteristics of the system.  

**Examples for the Booking Management Project:**
- The system shall handle at least 5,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.  
- The booking confirmation emails shall be delivered to users within 60 seconds.  
- The system shall be available 99.9% of the time (high availability).  
- The system shall ensure all sensitive user data is encrypted using industry-standard security protocols.  
- The system shall have a response time of less than 2 seconds for search queries.

## Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are a visual representation of how different actors (users or external systems) interact with the system. They show the systemâ€™s functionalities (use cases) and the relationships between actors and these use cases.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
- Provide a **clear overview** of system functionality.
- Help identify **actors and their interactions** with the system.
- Improve **communication** between stakeholders, analysts, and developers.
- Serve as a **blueprint** for creating detailed requirements and design documents.

### Use Case Diagram for Booking Management System
Below is a sample use case diagram for the booking management project:
